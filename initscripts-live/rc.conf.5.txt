NAME
----
rc.conf - Chakra GNU/Linux main configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/rc.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The /etc/rc.conf file is the system configuration file for Arch-specific
settings. The format is bash. It contains several commonly-edited settings such
as timezone; keymap; kernel modules; daemons to load at start-up; etc. It is
split up in a few sections to categorize configuration settings: localization,
hardware, networking and daemons.

LOCALIZATION[[L]]
-----------------
*TIMEZONE=*

Specifies the timezone. The setting takes effect on boot by ensuring that /etc/localtime is a symlink
to the correct zoneinfo file. Possible timezones are the relative path to a zoneinfo file starting
from the directory /usr/share/zoneinfo. For example, a German timezone would be Europe/Berlin,
which refers to the file /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin.

Note: if empty, /etc/localtime is not changed. This is useful if /etc/localtime is maintained manually
or by a third-party tool; or if there is no reason to change it from what was set during install.

Default: empty

*HARDWARECLOCK=*

How to interpret/update the hardware clock. (used by hwclock)

Options:

	- empty: fall back to the value in /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime, which defaults to UTC. This is recommended
	  as other users of hwclock might change the adjtime file and hence cause rc.conf and adjtime to be out of sync.
	- "UTC": most robust, allows operating systems to abstract local time and ease DST.
	- "localtime": apply timezone (and DST) in hardwareclock: discouraged.
	  Choose this if you dualboot with an OS which cannot handle UTC BIOS times correctly, like Windows (note
	  that recent Windows'es can use UTC, which is preferable).
	- any other value will result in the hardware clock being left untouched (useful for virtualization)

Default: empty

*KEYMAP=*

Defines the keymap to load with the loadkeys program on boot. Possible keymaps are
found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps. Please note that this setting is only valid for
your TTYs, not any graphical window managers or X. KEYMAP in /etc/vconsole.conf takes
precedence.

Default: empty

*CONSOLEFONT=*

Defines the console font to load with the setfont program on boot.
Possible fonts are found in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts (only needed for non-US).
FONT in /etc/vconsole.conf takes precedence.

Default: empty

*CONSOLEMAP=*

Defines the console map to load with the setfont program on boot. Possible maps are found in
/usr/share/kbd/consoletrans. Set this to a map suitable for the appropriate locale (8859-1 for Latin1,
for example) if you're using an UTF-8 locale and use programs that generate 8-bit output. If you're
using X11 for everyday work, don't bother, as it only affects the output of Linux console applications.
FONT_MAP in /etc/vconsole.conf takes precedence.

Default: empty

*LOCALE=*

This sets your system language, which will be used by all i18n-friendly applications and utilities.
See `locale -a` (or locale.gen) for available options. LANG in /etc/locale.conf takes precedence.
If unset, it falls back to the C locale.

Default: empty

*DAEMON_LOCALE=*

	- If set to 'yes', use $LOCALE as the locale during daemon startup and during the boot process.
	- If set to 'no', the C locale is used.

Default: "yes"

*USECOLOR=*

Use ANSI color sequences in startup messages

Default: "yes"

HARDWARE[[H]]
-------------
*MODULES=*

Modules to load at boot-up.  To blacklist modules, see "man modprobe.d".

Default: ().

*USEDMRAID=*

Scan for FakeRAID (dmraid) Volumes at startup.

Default: "no"

*USEBTRFS=*

Scan for BTRFS volumes at startup.

Default: "no"

*USELVM=*

Scan for LVM volume groups at startup, required if you use LVM.

Default: "no"

NETWORKING[[N]]
---------------
*HOSTNAME=*

Hostname of machine. Should also be put in /etc/hosts. The contents of
/etc/hostname (if not empty) takes precedence.

Default: empty

The following settings help you setting up a wired network.

*interface=*

Name of device. Use 'ip addr' or 'ls /sys/class/net/' to see all available interfaces.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration as well as DHCP.

*address=*

IP address.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration, empty for DHCP.

*netmask=*

Subnet mask.

Default: empty (which means 255.255.255.0)

Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*broadcast=*

Broadcast address.

Default: empty

Optional for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*gateway=*

Default route.

Default: empty

Required for manual configuration, ignored for DHCP.

*Static IP example*

	interface=eth0
	address=192.168.0.2
	netmask=255.255.255.0
	broadcast=192.168.0.255
	gateway=192.168.0.1

*DHCP example*

	interface=eth0
	address=
	netmask=
	gateway=

The following options might be needed for advanced use-cases.

*NETWORK_PERSIST=*

Setting this to "yes" will skip network shutdown. This is required if your root device is on NFS.

Default: "no"

*NETWORKS=*

This functionality is deprecated, please refer to the 'netcfg' documentation.

DAEMONS[[D]]
------------
*DAEMONS=*

Daemons to start at boot-up (in this order)
	- prefix a daemon with a ! to disable it
	- prefix a daemon with a @ to start it up in the background

If you are sure nothing else touches your hardware clock (such as ntpd or
a dual-boot), you might want to enable 'hwclock'. Note that this will only
make a difference if the hwclock program has been calibrated correctly.

If you use a network filesystem you should enable 'netfs'.

Default: (syslog-ng network crond)
